Export any WordPress database table or post type with pagination, filtering, and CSV download â€” directly from your admin or frontend.

== Description ==

**Smart WP Export** is a powerful and flexible plugin for exporting WordPress data from any database table or post type. With built-in filtering, pagination, and CSV export features, this tool is ideal for developers, site administrators, and anyone needing quick access to structured data.

= Key Features =

- Export any database table or custom post type
- Date range filters
- Column selection for export
- Pagination for large datasets
- CSV download capability
- REST API support
- Admin menu integration
- Shortcode for frontend export view

`/wp-json/smart-export/v1/table`
